This lesson introduces the principles of diffusion models, going from the original Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) to the more general Score-based models, and their links with flow matching.
Historically, diffusion models predate flow matching models, and were the first models to achieve high-quality image generation results comparable to GANs.
