This lesson introduces the principles of Bayesian inference, going from the Bayes rule and its meaning with respect to (machine) learning.

### All you need to know about probabilities

There are just two rules in probabilities: the sum rule and the product rule.

We start with binary random variables / events $A$ and $B$, but the rule extends to more outcomes and also to continuous random variables.

#### Disclaimer on notation, what the $p$?

Considering two events $A$ and $B$, we can write for instance write the joint probability as $$P(A, B)$$.
In some contexts, you might also see the notation $$p(A, B)$$ or $$p_{A,B}(a, b)$$ for the same thing.

The notation $$p_{A,B}(a, b)$$ is the most explicit, as it indicates that $p_{A,B}$ is a function (the probability distribution) for the random variables $A$ and $B$, and evaluated at the outcomes $a$ and $b$.

The notation $$p(A,B)$$ hides many things

- it aliases $p$ (the same exact symbol will be used for different distributions, e.g. $$p_A$$ and $$p_B$$, which can be confusing),
- it hides the fact that $p$ is a function (the probability distribution) evaluated at some values $a$ and $b$.

In practice this last notation is more compact and used heavily, when no ambiguity arises.
It additionally implies some quantification, e.g. $$p(A)$$ can mean $$p_A(a)$$ for some specific value $a$, or it can mean $$p_A(A)$$ for all possible values of $A$.

As such, for instance, the following rough symbol equivalences hold:

- $$p(A) \equiv p_A(a) \equiv p(A=a)$$
- $$p(A | B) \equiv p_{A|B}(a | b) \equiv p(A=a | B=b)$$

And, for example stating the independence of random variables $A$ and $B$ can in practice appear in multiple ways:

- $$\forall a,b, \;\;\; p_{A,B}(a,b) = p_A(a)p_B(b)$$
- $$\forall a,b, \;\;\; p(A=a, B=b) = p(A=a)p(B=b)$$
- $$p_{A,B}(a,b) = p_A(a)p_B(b)$$
- $$p(A=a, B=b) = p(A=a)p(B=b)$$
- $$p(A,B) = p(A)p(B)$$
- $$p(a,b) = p(a)p(b)$$

The last one is the most compact, but also among the most ambiguous, but it is often used in practice.

#### Sum rule

The sum rule states that, for a binary event $B$:

$$
P(A) = P(A, B) + P(A, \neg B)
$$

(or in typst) <T block v='P(A) = P(A, B) + P(A, not B)' />


More generally, the sum rule can be written as:

$$
P(A) = \sum_{b \in \text{outcomes of } B} P(A, b)
$$

(or in typst) <T block v='P(A) = sum_(b in "outcomes of " B) P(A, B=b)' />

or more compactly:

$$
P(A) = \sum_{b} P(A, B=b)
$$

or even more compactly:

$$
P(A) = \sum_{B} P(A, B)
$$

or even:

$$
p(a) = \sum_{b} p(a, b)
$$

or, more generally, as an integral, that with proper formalism covers both discrete and continuous random variables:

$$
P(a) = \int P(a, b) \, db
$$

or sometimes

$$
p(a) = \int_b p(a, b)
$$

#### Product rule

The product rule states that:

$$
\begin{align*}
P(A, B)
& = P(A|B) P(B) \\
& = P(B) P(A|B)
\end{align*}
$$

(or in typst) <T block v='
P(A, B)
& = P(A|B) P(B) \
& = P(B) P(A|B)
' />

This can be illustrated with the following Venn diagram:

<Cetz block v='
let base = teal;
cetz-venn.venn2(
    name: "venn",
    b-stroke: base.darken(20%),
    ab-stroke: base.darken(20%),
    ab-fill: base,
    ab-layer: 1,
    b-fill: base.lighten(50%),
    a-stroke: gray,
)
on-layer(2, content("venn.a", [A]));
on-layer(2, content("venn.b", [B]));
on-layer(2, content("venn.ab", [AB]));
' />

The product rule can be used in both directions, so we also have:

$$
P(A, B) = P(B|A) P(A)
$$


### Bayes rule

Using both directions of the product rule we can derive the Bayes rule.

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

(or in typst) <T block v='P(A|B) = (P(B|A) P(A)) / P(B)' />

Other forms of the Bayes rule can be obtained by applying the sum rule (and potentially the product rule again) to the denominator:

$$
\begin{align*}
P(A|B)
& = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{\sum_{a} p(B, A=a) } \
& = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{\sum_{a} P(B|A=a) P(A=a)} \
\end{align*}
$$

or with the ambiguous notation:

$$
\begin{align*}
p(b|a) &= \frac{p(a|b) p(b)}{p(a)} \
&= \frac{p(a|b) p(b)}{\sum_{b'} p(a|b') p(b')} \
&= \frac{p(a|b) p(b)}{\int_{b'} p(a|b') p(b')} \
\end{align*}
$$

(or in typst) <T block v="
p(b|a) = (p(a|b) p(b)) / p(a)
& = (p(a|b) p(b)) / (sum_(b') p(a|b') p(b'))
& = (p(a|b) p(b)) / (integral_(b') p(a|b') p(b'))
" />
